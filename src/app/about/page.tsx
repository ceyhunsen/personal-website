          I am a computer engineer by profession. I enjoy working on low-level
          software. In college, I was part of a team and took responsibility of
          developing low-level software for our projects. After college, I
          worked on Linux device drivers and BSP (Board Support Package)
          development. These fields are my favorite areas to work in and where
          my expertise lies.

          I also enjoy working on high-level software if the project is
          interesting. Currently, I work in the blockchain space. My previous
          experiences are detailed in my{" "}

          I also share some of my hobbies here, in this website. I ride my
